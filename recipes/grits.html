       <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (590ml) water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as desired</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (85g) yellow or white corn grits, preferably stone-ground</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In a 2-quart saucepan, combine water and salt and bring to a boil. While whisking, sprinkle in grits, then return to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook, whisking and scraping bottom well every 2 to 3 minutes, until you reach your desired consistency: runny with some remaining gritty texture, about 30 minutes; thick and creamy but flowing, about 45 minutes; or stiff and able to hold its shape while barely flowing, about 1 hour. Whisk in extra water, a tablespoon or two at a time, at any point if your grits become thicker than you'd like.</li>
            <li>Whisk in butter until fully melted and incorporated, then remove from heat. Season with additional salt, if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve as desired.</li>
        </ol>
